REPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Install all software mentioned in the section above 
2. In R:
	- Open Project Part_1.
	- Run Figure_1.R to replicate Figure_1.  Both panels of Figure 1 save as png files to the output folder.  Other supporting files will save to the output folder, as well. 
	- Run Figure_2.R to replicate Figure_2.  Figure 2 saves as a png to the output folder.
